# MSSC
source code for "Mining Statistically Significant Communities from Weighted Networks"

The input parameters are:
  the first one is the path of the network
  the second one is a boolean to declare the network type: True means the input network is a weighted network
                                                           False means the input network is a un-weighted network
   the third one is the type of nodes of the input network: "int" means the nodes' type is integer, the result communty will be sorted, others will not.
   
   the directroy of result community can be found in the same directory as the input network file. the file name is ended with "_mssc.txt"  .
